# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive Todo API backend in Go using the Gin web framework. The system will provide user authentication, JWT-based authorization, and full CRUD operations for todo items. The backend will be containerized with Docker and use PostgreSQL for data persistence. The project is designed as a professional job demo showcasing Go best practices, clean architecture, and modern development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register an account with email and password, so that I can access the todo system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration data to POST /register THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength
2. WHEN valid registration data is provided THEN the system SHALL hash the password using bcrypt
3. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user in PostgreSQL and return success response
4. WHEN duplicate email is provided THEN the system SHALL return 409 Conflict error
5. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to login with my credentials, so that I can receive an access token to use the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits login credentials to POST /login THEN the system SHALL validate email and password
2. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL verify password against stored hash
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate and return a JWT access token
4. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized error
5. WHEN login is successful THEN the JWT token SHALL contain user ID and expiration time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want all todo endpoints to be protected by JWT authentication, so that only I can access my todos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to any /todos endpoint THEN the system SHALL require a valid JWT token in Authorization header
2. WHEN a valid JWT token is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the token
3. WHEN token validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL extract user ID and add to Gin context
4. WHEN no token is provided THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized error
5. WHEN an invalid or expired token is provided THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create new todos, so that I can track my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits todo data to POST /todos THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (title)
2. WHEN valid todo data is provided THEN the system SHALL create todo with authenticated user as owner
3. WHEN todo creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 201 Created with todo details
4. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation errors
5. WHEN todo is created THEN the system SHALL associate it with the authenticated user's ID

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve all my todos, so that I can see my task list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests GET /todos THEN the system SHALL return only todos owned by the authenticated user
2. WHEN todos exist THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK with array of todo objects
3. WHEN no todos exist THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK with empty array
4. WHEN request is successful THEN each todo SHALL include id, title, description, completed status, and timestamps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve a specific todo by ID, so that I can view its details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests GET /todos/:id THEN the system SHALL validate the todo ID format
2. WHEN todo exists and belongs to user THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK with todo details
3. WHEN todo does not exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found error
4. WHEN todo belongs to different user THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found error
5. WHEN invalid ID format is provided THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to update my existing todos, so that I can modify task details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits update data to PUT /todos/:id THEN the system SHALL validate todo ownership
2. WHEN valid update data is provided THEN the system SHALL update the specified fields
3. WHEN update succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 200 OK with updated todo details
4. WHEN todo does not exist or belongs to different user THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found error
5. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to delete my todos, so that I can remove completed or unwanted tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests DELETE /todos/:id THEN the system SHALL validate todo ownership
2. WHEN todo exists and belongs to user THEN the system SHALL delete the todo
3. WHEN deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 204 No Content
4. WHEN todo does not exist or belongs to different user THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found error
5. WHEN todo is deleted THEN it SHALL be permanently removed from the database

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use PostgreSQL for data persistence, so that data is reliably stored and queryable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to PostgreSQL using environment variables
2. WHEN database connection is established THEN the system SHALL verify tables exist (users, todos)
3. WHEN tables don't exist THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts to create them
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use proper foreign key relationships between users and todos
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error responses

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be containerized with Docker, so that it can be easily deployed and run consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the Dockerfile SHALL create an optimized Go binary
2. WHEN running with docker-compose THEN the system SHALL start both API and PostgreSQL services
3. WHEN using environment variables THEN the system SHALL load configuration from .env file
4. WHEN containers start THEN the API SHALL wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
5. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL expose the API on the configured port

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that the API can be easily understood and tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN it SHALL include all endpoints with request/response schemas
2. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL provide interactive testing capabilities
3. WHEN endpoints are documented THEN they SHALL include authentication requirements
4. WHEN schemas are defined THEN they SHALL match actual request/response structures
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect current API implementation

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests, so that code quality and functionality are verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL cover all HTTP handlers and middleware functions
2. WHEN testing authentication THEN tests SHALL verify JWT token validation and user context
3. WHEN testing CRUD operations THEN tests SHALL verify database interactions and business logic
4. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL use mocked dependencies for isolation
5. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL achieve reasonable coverage of critical paths
